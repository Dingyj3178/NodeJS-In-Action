NodeJS-In-Action
================

Sample code and completed exercises from working through the book "NodeJS In Action" by Mike Cantelon, Marc Harter, T.J. Holowaychuk and Nathan Rajlich.

Various snippets of code haven't been included in the sample code available, so I've:

* added the missing ones
* completed all (?) of the exercises
* corrected a few minor things in the sample code
* added more comments
